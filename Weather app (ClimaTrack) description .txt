Weather app (ClimaTrack) with full CRUD


The idea of this app is to give users access to weather conditions as they travel or plan trips. Given that many people travel for work, this app is to help provide solution to those individuals to help stay up-to-date on weather conditions.


The app will be built using MERN full-stack and an weather API (OpenWeather)
